                <p class="lead">Try to do something that the website would not expect a normal user to do. Afterwards, you may see a message that you found a bug and you will automatically receive a reward for that! For instance, if you submit something on the website, the information will be processed by the server and the result will be shown to you on the page. What if you send something that a normal user would never think to send? Maybe you find a place where you could request a certain type of information from the server or you can try to tinker around on the page itself.</p>
