                <p class="lead">GenCyberCoin website has a bug bounty program! This program will reward you with coins if you find bugs (problems, errors) on the website.</p>
                <p class="lead">Try to do something that the website would not expect a normal user to do. Afterwards, you may see a message that you found a bug and you will automatically receive a reward for that! For instance, if you submit something on the website, the information will be processed by the server and the result will be shown to you on the page. What if you send something that a normal user would never think to send? Maybe you find a place where you could request a certain type of information from the server or you can try to tinker around on the page itself.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="sublead">Sensitive data exposure (hidden page that admin left somewhere in one of the pages' source code)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Broken authentication (find admin credentials)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Find a proposed standard which allows websites to define security policies (search this in the Internet and you shall stand on the path to find the answer to this one)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">User data input overflow (check out maxlength in page sources)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Reflected XSS (check out wallet)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Stored XSS (btw, did you leave us the feedback yet?)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">User input validation (wallet)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">HTML edits on social engineering page (how does the server know what question relate to what answer?)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Have you thought what happens if you transfer coins to yourself? (see in the wallet page source what "id" would be yours and then change it)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Local file inclusion (did you see that there are several pages of the items on the market?)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">HTML edits on market items (can you change the price of the items so that the money will actually come to you when you buy, instead of going out of your pocket?)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Race condition (when market is enabled, notice what changes in every item's HTML code when it is your turn; then, when it is not your turn, can you still try to buy something?)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Refresh on remove (when market is on)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Access a page that does not exist</li>

                <p class="lead">P.S.: If you see a page with yellow-ish background and some random code that does not make sense to you, that means you found a real bug that was not supposed to be there.
