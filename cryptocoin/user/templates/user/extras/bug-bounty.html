This program is a type of deal that is offered by websites, organizations, and even developers by which individuals will be compensated for finding bugs (errors, exploits, vulnerabilities) on websites or programs.<br><br><i>Bug Bounty</i> hunting is a real-world practice where people can receive monetary rewards on websites including <u><a href="https://www.hackerone.com/" target="_blank">HackerOne</a></u> and <u><a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/bug-bounty-list/" target="_blank">BugCrowd</a></u>. It can be quite profitable to participate in these “ethical hacking” Bug Bounty program events. A 10-year-old was reward $10,000 by Facebook in 2016 for finding a serious bug on Instagram! You can read more about that story here: Click <u><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/2016/5/3/11579972/facebook-10-year-old-hacking-instagram-security-bug-10k" target="_blank">here</a></u>.<br><br>Try to do something that the website would not expect a normal user to do. Finding a bug will present a special message, and you will be given REWARD coins! :D<br><br>Do note that some bugs will present codes that you will need to redeem in order to receive any REWARD coins; head to the <a href="https://gencybercoin.tk/wallet/" target="_blank"><u>Wallet</u></a> page to redeem them!<br><br>Hint: Right-click on a specific item on any page and select “Inspect” to see the underlying code.</span></p>
